# react-app-boilerplate-theme-ui

This is my simple react configuration for a minimalist project, using react, theme-ui, redux and apisauce.
>Note: see the main file style configuration in `./src/theme/index.js`!

## Running
There are three main commands in this project:
```sh
# run in a dev mode
yarn start

# run server
yarn run server

# build to production
yarn build
```

Enjoy! ðŸ‘‹
